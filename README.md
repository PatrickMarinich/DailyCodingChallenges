# DailyCodingChallenges
A Place where I upload my solutions to a daily coding challenge that I've Completed

The challenges come from the mailing list of DailyCodingProblem.com, I will include the possible solution that I came up with each day that I complete the challenge.

When I started completing the DailyCodingProblem my coding experiance included:
1. College Class in Java
2. College Class in Object Oriented Programming
3. College Class in C and Systems Programming
4. College Class in Data Structures
5. Self Taught in Python, inclduing projects using Keras and Pandas 
6. MATLAB usuage in my Engineering Classes
7. Lab courses where I was able to use Excel, Python, and Verilog at my dicression

Below is a table of entires for each of the challenges that I've completed, they are in the format of:

Completed #, Date assigned, Difficulty(From The Email), My Difficulty Score, topic

Note: I may complete the challenges out of order if I miss a day, thus the dates may be out of order. 
They will be in order of completion, not nessassarly when they are assigned.

**Completed Days:**
1. May 23rd 2022, Easy, 2/10, Checking for summed Values in an Array
2. May 24th 2022, Hard, 3/10, Multiplication of only some Array Elements
3. May 26th 2022, Hard, 6/10, Looking for consecutive positive integers in an array
4. May 25th 2022, Medium, 9/10, Binary Tree serialization and deserialization


**Any Notes About My Solution**
1. A bit tricky to find optimization to complete the bonus aspect
2. My first solution answered the follow up, I am upset with myself that I did not even consider the easier approach by just using division, I think that the tag of HARD from the email led me to think of more complex solutions without even considering easy ones
3. My idea for the solution came quickly, however broke when repeating numbers were added into the array, finding this solution took me a couple extra minutes, and accounted for the majority of my dev time for this challenge
4. The most challenging thus far. This may have came from my misintrepretation of using a binary search tree rather than 
    a binary tree as specified in the problem. I was a bit rusty when creating my insert function. Overall Though but fun! I had to use a ton of recursion which is great practice for sure
