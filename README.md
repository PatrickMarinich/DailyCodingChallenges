# DailyCodingChallenges
A Place where I upload my solutions to a daily coding challenge that I've Completed

The challenges come from the mailing list of DailyCodingProblem.com, I will include the possible solution that I came up with each day that I complete the challenge.

When I started completing the DailyCodingProblem my coding experiance included:
1. College Class in Java
2. College Class in Object Oriented Programming
3. College Class in C and Systems Programming
4. College Class in Data Structures
5. Self Taught in Python, inclduing projects using Keras and Pandas 
6. MATLAB usuage in my Engineering Classes
7. Lab courses where I was able to use Excel, Python, and Verilog at my dicression

Below is a table of entires for each of the challenges that I've completed, they are in the format of:
Completed #, Date assigned, Difficulty(From The Email), My Difficulty Score, Other

Note: I may complete the challenges out of order if I miss a day, thus the dates may be out of order. 
They will be in order of completion, not nessassarly when they are assigned.

**Completed Days:**
1. May 23rd 2022, Easy, 2/10, 3/10 to find optimization
2. May 24th 2022, Hard, 3/10, first solution answered the follow up
3. May 26th 2022, Hard, 6/10, the idea for the solution came fast however it was tricky to solve the case of repeating numbers
